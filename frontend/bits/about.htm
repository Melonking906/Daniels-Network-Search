	<h2>What is Daniel's Network?</h2>
	<p>
		Hi Humans, seems you've found your way onto the Network! Welcome! This is a search engine made from scratch thats dedicated to all the weird, wacky and interesting corners of the web.
	</p>
	<p>
		Its a curated search engine, so our crawler does not just pull any old site off the web, each site is submitted by a user and pages are automatically indexed for key words and content. Only sites that fit the theme are approved for indexing.
	</p>
	<p>
		In an age where everyone is so obsessed with clean lines, efficient code and doing things the "right" way. Its important to remember that the web can be weird and wacky and be about fun no perfection. Thats why the network is here.
	</p>

	<h2>Get Involved!</h2>

	<p>
		Yes you too can be a part of the wacky web. If you know a site that would suit our theme click the submit tab to add it to the network! 
	</p>
	<p>
		Or if you're very adventurous you could make your own site, we have some tutorials and suggestions over in the tab section too.
	</p>

	<h2>Who is Molly?</h2>
	<p>
		You may have noticed Molly the search cactus up in the top left corner. Molly is part of the Molly Network, a sub network of Daniel's Net. Molly units all poses independent communication and seem to enjoy sending anonymous gifts from different web users to each other :O
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps you would like to send a gift yourself? I know you'd like too! Just be careful sending storms, you know what they say. What goes around comes around...
	</p>

	<h2>Can I make a custom search bar?</h2>
	<p>
		You sure can, just send your query to "https://danielsnet.net/?q=QUERY", same as most other searches :P
	</p>
	<strong>Here is an example:</strong>
	<form method="GET" action="https://danielsnet.net/" ><input type="text" name="q" /><input type="submit" value="Search!" /></form>
	<br/>
	<textarea><form method="GET" action="https://danielsnet.net/" ><input type="text" name="q" /><input type="submit" value="Search!" /></form></textarea>
