        Make Your Own Website!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Making a website is not hard, sure you can get into complex fancy features, but the basics? Anyone can do them.<br />
        Not only can anyway make a website, but everyone should! It doesn't need a topic, you can just make a scrapbook of your daily life.
    </p>
    <h2>Reasons to make a website:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You'll learn about how the web works, its not magic, you can do it!</li>
        <li>You'll have made something thats truly yours, no 2 websites have to look the same if you don't want them to.</li>
        <li>You'll have something that will last, when a social network closes everything on it is lost, but a static website can be saved forever.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How do I get my site online!?</h2>
    <p>
        If you want other people to be able to browse your site, you'll need to upload it to the internet.<br />
        For that you'll need to put it on a server, there are many companies that offer servers, here are some good indie ones.
